# CHEM 330: Aquatic Chemistry

Environmental aquatic chemistry is the branch of environmental chemistry that deals with chemical phenomena in water.  Aquatic chemistry is concerned with the chemical processes affecting the distribution and circulation of chemical compounds in natural waters.  One goal is to describe and predict the chemical behavior of oceans, estuaries, rivers, lakes, groundwater, and soil water systems, and to describe the processes involved in water treatment. The study of aquatic chemistry draws on the fundamentals of chemistry but is also influenced by other sciences, especially geology and biology. 

This course is an introduction to environmental aquatic chemistry.  It is a hybrid between a traditional quantitative analysis course and aquatic chemistry course, focusing on both the analytical and theoretical aspects of aquatic chemistry.  Topic such as colorimetric, gravimetric, titrimetric, and instrumental analysis will be covered along with the distribution, fate, transport, and reaction kinetics of chemical species in the aquatic environment.  It is expected that students will have taken CHEM 139 and CHEM 140 (the General Chemistry sequence) prior to enrolling in this course; CHEM 232 (Quantitative Analysis) is recommended but not required.  Simultaneous enrollment in CHEM 330 Lab is expected.
