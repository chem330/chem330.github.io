Water Hardness Instructor / Prep Information
============================================

This experiment requires the following items.

# Supplies

- Burettes
- Stir plates + stir bars
- Erlenmeyer flasks or beakers
- Ring stands and burette clamps
- 20-ml pipettes
- 10-ml pipettes
- PE bottles for sample collection (1 L)
- 500 ml PE bottles for samples storage
- Sample storage at 4 C
- Waste container (4 L)

# Reagents

- Analytical grade disodium EDTA - to be made to 0.02 N in lab
- 0.02 N Calcium Carbonate (primary standard)
  - Standard calcium solution 0.02 N: Place 1.000 g anhydrous calcium carbonate (primary standard low in metals) in a 500 mL flask. Add, a little at a time, 1 + 1 HCl (6.4.2) until all of the $\ce{CaCO3}$ has dissolved. Add 200 mL distilled water. Boil for a few minutes to expel $\ce{CO2}$. Cool. Add a few drops of methyl red indicator (6.4.3) and adjust to intermediate orange color by adding 3N $\ce{NH4OH}$ (6.4.4) or 1 + 1 HCl (6.4.2) as required. Quantitatively transfer to a 1 liter volumetric flask and dilute to mark with distilled water.
  - Methyl red indicator: Dissolve 0.10 g methyl red in distilled water in a 100 mL volumetric flask and dilute to the mark.
  - Ammonium hydroxide solution, 3 N: Dilute 210 mL of conc. $\ce{NH4OH}$ to 1-liter with distilled water.
- HCl and $\ce{HNO3}$ (1:1)
- Water hardness odorless buffer (LabChem)
- Calmagite indicator, 0.1% (LabChem)
