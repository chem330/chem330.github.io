# Tentative Course Schedule

The schedule and topics will change somewhat as we progress through the semester to meet the needs of the class.  Expect daily reading, weekly homework assignments, and 3-4 exams plus a final.

The intent is for this course to be very hands-on.  As such, Monday and Wendesday lectures will often be geared to preparing for that week's lab, and the Friday lecture periods may be used as hybrid data-processing workshops and lectures.  As we move through the semester, you should become more and more self-sufficient in the lab, so this format will move more toward a pure lecture format as the semester progresses.

**I will pull topics from following material:**

 1. Harvey Chapters 1-5
 2. Weiner Chapters 1-6
 
 I will jump around in the texts a bit, so certain sections from other chapters may be covered, too.

# Lab Schedule

The lab consists of two parts: (1) *learning* techniques by completing basic labs during the first part of the semester and (2) *applying* those techniques to study a real-world problem during the second part of the semester.

Lab assignments are due at 23:59:59 on Tuesday unless otherwise specified. The best place to keep track of due dates is Canvas.

*This schedule is subject to change as needed.*

| 19   | Dec 14 | *Final Exams - No Lab*                    |

*During the project lab, students will complete alkalinity titrations, nitrate and phosphate analysis, fecal coliform analysis, and hardness analysis independently / in groups.  Small groups of students will meet with the instructor to learn how to use the ion chromatograph and/or mercury analyzer, and will then complete those anlyses of their samples.*
