# Background

# Procedure

## Samples

Use the samples provided in lab.

## Standard Preparation



## Determination of Phosphate

The following procedure should be performed on each of your 6 calibration standards and each of your water samples.

1. Place 25 mL of each standard and sample into separate 50-mL flasks.
2. Create a blank with 25 mL of deionized water.
3. Add the contents of one NitraVer5 Nitrate reagent packet to each sample.  **Be careful!**  There is Cd metal in the reagent packet, so the contents of the reagent packet are toxic.  Wear gloves, goggles, and avoid inhaling the reagent powder.  Be careful about what you touch with your gloves.
4. Swirl each flask vigorously for 1 minute.
Wait at least 5 minutes, but no longer than 15 minutes before reading the absorbance of each sample.
