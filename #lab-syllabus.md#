## Overview 

This course in an introduction to the chemical analysis of water samples.  Throughout the semester, students will work to develop both qualitative and quantitative analytical skills related to chemical analysis (both wet chemical and instrumental analysis methods), reproducible data analysis, scientific communication, and collaboration in the laboratory and field.  Some prerequisite chemical knowledge will be expected (CHEM 140), but no advanced chemistry knowledge is necessary.  Simultaneous enrollment in CHEM 330 lecture is expected.

## Student Learning Outcomes 

To achieve a satisfactory grade, students will:

1. Demonstrate proficiency in common analytical methods applied to aquatic samples.

1. Demonstrate rigorous, reproducible laboratory practice.

1. Apply common analytical methods and concepts from general chemistry to fully, accurately, and precisely characterize real-world samples.

1. Communicate analysis questions, methods, results, and conclusions using written word, pictorial figures, and data tables.

1. Demonstrate safe laboratory practices.

1. Participate effectively in group projects and demonstrate professionalism in the laboratory.

## Required Course Materials

  - Appropriate clothing: closed-toed shoes, long pants, hair tie for long hair
  - Permanent, felt-tipped marker (e.g. a SharpieÂ®)
  - A hardbound paper notebook for jotting down notes in lab
  - A blue or black pen (not pencil!) for writing in your lab notebook.

Most materials are available from the WCU bookstore; goggles are also available from the WCU Chemistry Club (these goggles are recommended over cheaper ones).  A lab coat is optional.

*Students not wearing appropriate PPE will be asked to leave lab.*

See "Field Work", below, for addition recommended materials.

## Lab Notebooks and Data Analysis 

Lab notebooks will be collected weekly for review.  You should follow proper laboratory notebook protocol when filling out your notebook.  **Lab notebooks should be filled out during lab, not after!**  Students will be required to scan their lab notebook pages and turn them in on Canvas each day when leaving lab.

Students will be provided with Excel templates for data analysis, and must turn in their templates and data files for each lab.  The Excel sheets will be checked for accuracy against calculations completed by the instructor, and students will be awarded full credit for getting the *exact* right answer, to the correct number of significant digits.  Partial credit may be awarded for close answers.

## Field Work

Portions of this course will be conducted outdoors in the field while collecting water samples for analysis.  This work may occur both on and off campus.  Students should make every effort to attend field trips, and will receive a grade for participation trips.  Any students not attending will be required to complete a makeup assignment with equal time and effort committments as the field trip.  Field work will occur rain or shine.

The following materials are recommended during sampling days.  Keep in mind that all these materials may get dirty / rained on / fall in the river, etc., during field work, so don't bring your most favorite items unless you are prepared for them to get damaged.

- Waterproof shoes (preferrably knee-high boots or waders)
- Rain jacket
- Waterproof backpack
- Waterproof notebook (e.g. Rite in the Rain) and Sharpie or pencil
- Water bottle, snacks, and a picnic lunch

## Use of Chemical Instrumentation

This course will require the use of equipment in Chemistry's shared instrumentation facility.  Students will be required to coordinate with Chemistry's Instrumentation Specialist to get trained on these instruments outside of normal class time.

## Grading 

Your grade will be determined based on your *mastery* of the Student Learning Outcomes (SLO) for the course, and you will receive both qualitative and quantitative feedback throughout the semester.  Most assignments will have a rubric based on these outcomes, and you can track your mastery through the semester.  Your level of mastery updates through the semester based on current and past performance, and may go up or down just like a grade.  As a general rule, a level of mastery of 5 indicates "A" level mastery, 4 "B" level, and so on.  Some assignments may provide feedback in real time, for example, by telling your if your calculation is correct or not as you enter it in your notebook; although there is no grade assigned to this, it is considered when judging your mastery and you should be easily getting the correct answer on all items by the end of the semester.

Each SLO is given a score of 5 points in Canvas, and your final grade will be determined by summing your score for each and dividing by 30 (the total number of points possible) and multiplying by 100.  This gives your average level of mastery and yields a number ranging from 0-100.  This will be compared to the scale below to determine your final grade. (Relative weights for each SLO may change if needed.)

If you are unsure how to calculate your grade please ask your instructor.

### Grading Scale

| Number Range | Letter Grade |
|:------------:|:------------:|
|    97-100    |      A+      |
|   93-96.9    |      A       |
|   90-92.9    |      A-      |
|   87-89.9    |      B+      |
|   83-86.9    |      B       |
|   80-82.9    |      B-      |
|   77-79.9    |      C+      |
|   73-76.9    |      C       |
|   70-72.9    |      C-      |
|   67-69.9    |      D+      |
|   63-66.9    |      D       |
|   60-62.9    |      D-      |
|     <60      |      F       |

These grades indicate levels in mastery from excellent to poor.  Students are responsible for knowing class attendance, withdrawal, and drop-add policies and procedures.

## Turning Things In

Most assignments will be submitted electronically.  Unless otherwise specified, assignments are due at 23:59:59 the night before lab and late work is not accepted.  A list of anticipated assignments is available in the Canvas site for the course, but is subject to change as needed.  *Canvas is the best place to track due dates!*

### Submitting Assignments

When turning in assignments:

 - Files should be uploaded to the assignment page on Canvas.
 - Files should be of the types and quantity specified in the assignment.
 - Files should be given a clear, logical filename.
 - Files may be sorted automatically by a computer.  Therefore, any files not named appropriately, not in the specified format, or submitted elsewhere (e.g. email) may not be graded.
 - Any electronic assignments turned in via hardcopy will not be graded.

Submissions that do not follow these guidelines may incur point deductions or may not be graded.

### Late Work

Late work is not accepted in this course.  Due dates are automatically enforced by Canvas.  However, I will leave assignments open until I grade them and you can turn them in until then (this may be the day they are due or it may be a week later).  No extensions will be granted after the assignment has been graded.

If you experience *extenuating circumstances* (e.g. a medical emergency, professionally diagnosed illness, or death in the family) or a [*university-sponsored absence*](https://www.wcu.edu/experience/health-and-wellness/student-concern-response-team/absence-notification-protocol.aspx) you may ask to be considered for an extension on a case-by-base basis.  Communication of the issue to your instructor and identification of when you plan to turn in the assignment are important in such circumstances.  For university-sponsored absences, exceptions should be arranged *before* your absence or will not be granted.

## Course Policies 

**Laboratory Behavior:** Students are expected to attend each lab period and participate fully in that day's activity.  Students should respect the rights of others and minimize avoidable distractions and come to lab prepared.

You should bring your computer, notebook, pen, and calculator to EVERY laboratory meeting.  Please read the introduction and procedure for the experiment BEFORE coming to lab.  You can set up your lab notebook pages with the introduction, template procedure, and blank tables for recording lab data before you come to lab.

*Never bring food or drink into the laboratory.*  This includes sealed bottles and items inside backpacks â leave them outside the lab!  Do not chew gum, use tobacco products, or apply cosmetics in the lab.  Do not place personal items inside fume hoods or where they may come into contact with chemicals.  Keep walkways clear of chairs, bookbags, etc. (place them in cubbies!).  Wash your hands before leaving lab, and never wear gloves or lab coats outside the lab!

The sparing use of cell phones during lab sessions is permitted but discouraged. If you must, please use your cell phone outside the laboratory, and never leave an experiment unattended to do so!  Likewise, do not place your cellphone in a fume hood or on a chemical bench!

In an effort to maintain a productive work environment for all students, please refrain from playing music, videos, etc., in the classroom/laboratory.

**Proper Laboratory Attire:** Students must arrive to lab wearing appropriate attire.  Students without appropriate attire will be asked to leave and will not be able to complete the activity for the day (and will be counted absent).

- Wear eye protection at all times (whenever you are in the room).
- Wear closed-toed shoes that fully cover your feet up to the ankle at all times.
- Wear long pants that extend over the top of your shoes at all times.
- Wear a hair tie for long hair.
- Never wear tank tops, sleeveless shirts, shorts, or sandals.

**After-hours Instrument Access:** You may occasionally want to conduct analyses outside of class time.  The instrument lab is typically open from 8AM to 4PM M-F; please plan your work to fit within that time (it's OK to start a run at the end of the day and leave it to run overnight).  If you are completing work outside of class you must work with a lab partner who is also familiar with the instrument you're working on.  *Never work in the lab alone!*  Likewise, please refrain from bringing guests into the instrument lab unless they have specifically passed the instrument safety training.  If you will require significant help on the instrument please schedule a time to meet with your instructor or the Instrumentation Specialist in advance.

**Pregnancy:** Certain chemicals can have severe harmful effects on unborn children.  Any student who is pregnant or might have become pregnant and wished to avoid these hazards should notify her TA or instructor before conducting any laboratory work so that proper safety precautions can be taken.

**Attendance:** Please email your instructor *ahead of time* if you encounter circumstances that absolutely prevent you from making it to lab on time.  Attendance to all class periods is mandatory. Absences from group work sessions may incur a loss of points up to a zero for the assignment and deductions in the student's group participation grade.  

If you experience any symptoms of COVID-19, cold, flu, or other contagious sickness please do NOT come to class!  Likewise, do not attend if you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or is suspected to have COVID-19.  Please maintain diligent communication with your instructor during these situations and appropriate accommodations will be made.

**Inclement Weather:** Please check the University website for campus closings during times of bad weather.  Your safety is a priority when traveling. Use common sense when attempting to get to campus and notify your instructor if you are unable to safely make it.  Announcements will be made via e-mail if class must be canceled when the University has not officially closed.
