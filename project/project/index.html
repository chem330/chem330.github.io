<p>The goal of the lab project this semester is to provide the Town of Black Mountain &#40;TOBM&#41; with <em>accurate</em> data they can use as a baseline dataset for their stormwater program.  The results from your analyses will be shared with Black Mountain.  Since this data will be used to inform TOBM about the water quality in the Swannanoa River and its tributaries, it is imperative that it is of the highest quality&#33;  As you work through each lab be vigilant about avoiding contamination, and use appropriate quality control measures to check your accuracy and precision as you work.  You <em>must</em> get an accurate answer before turning in your final report; if your results are not accurate or have unacceptably low precision you must repeat the analysis again to obtain high-quality data.</p>
<p><em>One intent for this project is to help you become self-sufficient in the lab and help you learn how to know that your data is likely to be accurate.  As such, there will be little day-to-day direction of your activities from your instructor, and it will be up to you and your lab partner to plan your time and implement appropriate practices in your lab work.</em></p>
<h1 id="sample_collection"><a href="#sample_collection" class="header-anchor">Sample Collection</a></h1>
<p>Samples will be collected in several locations in Black Mountain, NC &#40;shown below&#41;.</p>

</li>
<li><p>&#40;This step has been done for you.&#41; Fill one of the bottles with DI water as a field blank.</p>

<li><p>Fill out information on attached datasheet. <div class="note"><div class="title">âš  Note</div>
<div class="content">You will need to make measurements of dissolved oxygen &#40;DO&#41; and temperature with the YSI meter.</div></div></p>
</li>
<li><p>Collect water samples â€“ be mindful of contamination as you do this&#33;</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use labeling tape and a permanent marker to place a label on the sample bottle listing the sampling site, your name, and the date.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open the field blank while you are collecting samples.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter the water &#40;if it is safe to do so&#41; and wait a minute for any sediment to settle or get carried away.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open the bottle and rinse it with a small amount of water from the river; discard the rinse water.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fill the bottle with water from the river, making sure to sample upstream of where you are standing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Immediately cap the bottle and keep it capped until sample processing or analysis.</p>

<li><p>Process the samples.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Filter the samples through a 0.45 Î¼m filter using a Millipore apparatus.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Take approximately 250 ml of sample and place it in a clean plastic bottle.  Acidify with sulfuric acid to pH &lt; 2.  This sample will be used for nitrate analysis.  &#40;You can use pH paper to measure the pH.&#41;</p>

<h1 id="analysis"><a href="#analysis" class="header-anchor">Analysis</a></h1>
<p>For each analysis you perform, you should create a daily plan and check in with Dr. Fischer prior to beginning the analysis.  When you finish the analysis, you should share your results with Dr. Fischer prior to moving on to the next analysis.  It is in your best interest to process as much data as possible in real time.</p>
<p><em>You may need to make solutions and gather equipment as part of your lab work, even if they were provided during previous labs.  The main exceptions to this will be any solutions requiring the use of concentrated acids or bases, or exceptionally toxic chemicals &#40;e.g. mercury&#41;.</em></p>
<p><strong>You should conduct the following analyses on your samples:</strong></p>

<h1 id="reporting"><a href="#reporting" class="header-anchor">Reporting</a></h1>
<p>You should present your results in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A professional-quality lab report written in the style of a USGS water quality report.  &#40;This counts toward your lab grade.&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>A professional-quality pamphlet showing a summary of the results, prepared in the style of a municipal consumer confidence report &#40;CCR&#41;. &#40;This will count as part of your final exam grade for lecture.&#41;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There will likely be a lot of overlap between these two documents â€“ if you plan appropriately you may be able to use many of the same figures and data tables.  The focus of the lab report is the lab work and the results from it, with some comparisons to other data sources for context.  The focus of the CCR-type report should be on summarizing the results and their implications for a general audience.</p>
<h2 id="lab_report"><a href="#lab_report" class="header-anchor">Lab Report</a></h2>
<p>This report should be written as if it were a professional document prepared to be shared with aquatic chemists and other water-quality professionals who are familiar with water chemistry and chemical analysis.  You can assume this knowledge when writing it &#40;e.g. you do not need to explian what a titration is, but rather can just say you performed a specific type of titration&#41;.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You may want to view my <a href="https://chem370.github.io/technical-reports/writing-guide">style guide</a> for scientific writing.  You should follow these guidelines when writing your report.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You may also want to view my <a href="https://chem370.github.io/technical-reports/figures">guide to publication-quality figure</a>.  All figures in your reports should be &quot;publication quality&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some example reports are available via <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/423/pdf/report.pdf">this link</a> &#40;PDF&#41; and <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2009/5149/pdf/sir20095149.pdf">this link</a> &#40;PDF&#41;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A Word template for your report will be posted soon.</em></p>
<p><strong>Your report should include the following sections:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Title</p>
</li>
<li><p>Abstract</p>
</li>
<li><p>Introduction</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Purpose and Scope</p>

<h2 id="consumer_confidence_report"><a href="#consumer_confidence_report" class="header-anchor">Consumer Confidence Report</a></h2>
<p>This report should be written as if it were a professional document designed to be shared with the general public.  It should be designed to educate people who are unfamiliar with water quality parameters about the importance of each parameter and how it relates to the bigger picture.  Write this as if you were explaining your lab work to a family member or friend who is not a scientist.</p>
<p>A good example CCR is the <a href="https://cityofraleigh0drupal.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/drupal-prod/COR25/2021CCR.pdf">City of Raleigh CCR</a> &#40;PDF&#41;.  Every public water supply is required to provide a CCR to it&#39;s users &#40;including <a href="https://www.wcu.edu/WebFiles/FM-2020-Annual-Drinking-Water-Quality-Report.pdf">WCU</a>&#33;&#41;, so feel free to browse for additional examples.</p>
<p>Your CCR should include a short &#40;~1 paragraph&#41; summary of each parameter measured and why it&#39;s important.  You should also include the data you measured with &quot;typical&quot; values for context.  It is important to explain why each parameter is important and also give context as to whether each value you measured is normal or cause for alarm.</p>
<div class="note"><div class="title">âš  Note</div>
<div class="content">CCRs are provided for drinking water.  Since we are measuring surface water as part of a stormwater program, this is not a true CCR&#33;  It is just a convenient format for us to use for reporting the results.</div></div>
