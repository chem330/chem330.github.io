# Phosphate Determination

  \note{ You must use the Agilent 8453 Diode Array UV-visible Spectrometer for this analysis.  You will need to get trained by [Matt Burleson](https://www.wcu.edu/faculty/mburleson.aspx), CHPH Instrumentation Specialist prior to using the instrument.  Please contact him to arrange training.}

- You should determine the concentration of phosphate in your samples using the method presented in Experiment 3.

- You will need to make 5 nitrate standards that bracket the sample concentration; you should also make a QC sample and run appropriate blanks as needed.

  - A passing QC will be $\pm 10\%$ of the expected value.
  - A passing $R^2$ will be $>0.990$.

- You should run your sample in **triplicate** and report the nitrate concentration as $\mu \pm \text{CI}$ using a confidence level of $\alpha=0.05$.  Report your results in mg/L nitrate.
