# Nitrate Determination

You should determine the concentration of nitrate in your samples using the NitraVer 5 method (the same method used in Experiment 2).

You will need to make 5 nitrate standards that bracket the sample concentration; you should also make a QC sample and run appropriate blanks as needed.

You should run your sample in triplicate and report the nitrate concentration as $\mu \pm \text{CI}$ using a confidence level of $\alpha=0.05$.

  \note{ You must use the Agilent 8453 Diode Array UV-visible Spectrometer for this analysis.  You will need to get trained by [Matt Burleson](https://www.wcu.edu/faculty/mburleson.aspx), CHPH Instrumentation Specialist prior to using the instrument.  Please contact him to arrange training.}
