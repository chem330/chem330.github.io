Hydrochemical Facies
=========================

\toc

# Background

Water samples may be described by their chemical makeup, and the field of geochemistry has developed specific, standard ways of plotting the chemical makeup of water.  Often, this referred to as an analysis of hydrochemical facies, where a facies (note that facies is singular!) is a geochemical body with distinctive characteristics.  Thus, analysis of hydrochemical facies provides a way of understanding which samples have a distinct chemical makeup with respect to important hydrologic parameters.  Learning to interpret and prepare these plots is an important step toward becoming fluent in the language of aquatic chemistry.  The goal of this exercise is expose you to these types of plots and help you learn to create them in MATLAB.

Before you continue, read sections 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 in Water Chemistry (p. 72-76), paying special attention to Figures 2.6 and 2.7.

# Exercise

1. Go to the Lab 3 Canvas assignment, and click the link to the MATLAB live script there.
2. Follow further instructions in the live script.

\note{ The live script contains a lot of information to read, too.  You should be reading it carefully and working out the problems as you read. If you skip things, you will likely feel lost!}
