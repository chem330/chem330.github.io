<p><strong>Lab Manual:</strong> All lab activities are posted <a href="https://chem330.github.io">online</a></p>
<p><strong>Lab Notebook:</strong> A notebook with hardbound pages is required for use as a laboratory notebook.  Although there are dedicated lab notebook options available, you don&#39;t not necessarily need anything fancy â€“ a simple black and white composition notebook will work.  Alternatively, if you have room left in your carbonless copy notebook from CHEM 139/140, you may use that.</p>
<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Students will need a laptop computer meeting Chemistry and Physics&#39; <a href="https://www.wcu.edu/learn/academic-services/it/computer-guidelines/index.aspx">minimum computer requirements</a> and should plan to bring this computer with them to lab every week.</p>
<p>Students will need the following software:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vernier <a href="https://www.vernier.com/downloads/logger-lite-updates/">Logger Lite</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.vernier.com/product/spectral-analysis/">Vernier Spectral Analysis</a> &#40;free&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Microsoft Office, especially Excel. &#40;&quot;free&quot; through WCU â€“ install through your WCU email if you don&#39;t already have it, ask IT for help if needed&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Required Course Materials:</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Goggles or safety glasses with splash gaurds rated for chemical protection</p>

</li>
<li><p>A blue or black pen &#40;not pencil&#33;&#41; for writing in your lab notebook.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most materials are available from the WCU bookstore; goggles are also available from the WCU Chemistry Club &#40;these goggles are recommended over cheaper ones&#41;.  A lab coat is optional.</p>
<p><em>Students not wearing appropriate PPE will be asked to leave lab.</em></p>
<p>See &quot;Field Work&quot;, below, for addition recommended materials.</p>
<h2 id="lab_notebooks_and_data_analysis"><a href="#lab_notebooks_and_data_analysis" class="header-anchor">Lab Notebooks and Data Analysis </a></h2>
<p>Lab notebooks will be collected weekly for review.  You should follow proper laboratory notebook protocol when filling out your notebook.  <strong>Lab notebooks should be filled out during lab, not after&#33;</strong>  Students will be required to scan their lab notebook pages and turn them in on Canvas each day when leaving lab.</p>
<p>Students will be provided with Excel templates for data analysis, and must turn in their templates and data files for each lab.  The Excel sheets will be checked for accuracy against calculations completed by the instructor, and students will be awarded full credit for getting the <em>exact</em> right answer, to the correct number of significant digits.  Partial credit may be awarded for close answers.</p>
<h2 id="field_work"><a href="#field_work" class="header-anchor">Field Work</a></h2>
<p>Portions of this course will be conducted outdoors in the field while collecting water samples for analysis.  This work may occur both on and off campus.  This year, we will travel to Black Mountain, NC to collect water samples from the Swannanoa River; the analysis results will be shared with the Town of Black Mountain stormwater program.  Students should make every effort to attend this field trip, and you will receive a grade for participation in the trip.  Any students not attending will be required to complete a makeup assignment with equal time and effort committments as the field trip.  Field work will occur rain or shine.</p>
<p>The following materials are recommended during sampling days.  Keep in mind that all these materials may get dirty / rained on / fall in the river, etc., during field work, so don&#39;t bring your most favorite items unless you are prepared for them to get damaged.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Waterproof shoes &#40;preferrably knee-high boots or waders&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rain jacket</p>
</li>
<li><p>Waterproof backpack</p>
</li>
<li><p>Waterproof notebook &#40;e.g. Rite in the Rain&#41; and Sharpie or pencil</p>
</li>
<li><p>Water bottle, snacks, and a picnic lunch</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Town of Black Mountain may take photos for educations / PR materials during this trip.  Any students wishing not to appear in these materials should notify their instructor.  Release forms will be provided to students prior to the trip.</p>
<h2 id="grading"><a href="#grading" class="header-anchor">Grading </a></h2>
<p>Your grade is tied directly to the student learning outcomes for the course.  Each SLO will be assessed as below.  Each assignment will be categorized by SLO and used to assess your progress in achieving that objective.  Your final grade will be determined by calculating the weighted average &#40;out of 100&#41; across all SLOs using the weightings listed in parentheses. If you are unsure how to calculate your grade please ask your instructor.</p>
