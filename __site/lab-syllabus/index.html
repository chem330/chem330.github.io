<p>Students will be provided with Excel templates for data analysis, and must turn in their templates and data files for each lab.  The Excel sheets will be checked for accuracy against calculations completed by the instructor, and students will be awarded full credit for getting the <em>exact</em> right answer, to the correct number of significant digits.  Partial credit may be awarded for close answers.</p>
<h2 id="field_work"><a href="#field_work" class="header-anchor">Field Work</a></h2>
<p>Portions of this course will be conducted outdoors in the field while collecting water samples for analysis.  This work may occur both on and off campus.  Students should make every effort to attend field trips, and will receive a grade for participation trips.  Any students not attending will be required to complete a makeup assignment with equal time and effort committments as the field trip.  Field work will occur rain or shine.</p>
<p>The following materials are recommended during sampling days.  Keep in mind that all these materials may get dirty / rained on / fall in the river, etc., during field work, so don&#39;t bring your most favorite items unless you are prepared for them to get damaged.</p>

<h2 id="use_of_chemical_instrumentation"><a href="#use_of_chemical_instrumentation" class="header-anchor">Use of Chemical Instrumentation</a></h2>
<p>This course will require the use of equipment in Chemistry&#39;s shared instrumentation facility.  Students will be required to coordinate with Chemistry&#39;s Instrumentation Specialist to get trained on these instruments outside of normal class time.</p>
<h2 id="grading"><a href="#grading" class="header-anchor">Grading </a></h2>
<p>Your grade will be determined based on your <em>mastery</em> of the Student Learning Outcomes &#40;SLO&#41; for the course, and you will receive both qualitative and quantitative feedback throughout the semester.  Most assignments will have a rubric based on these outcomes, and you can track your mastery through the semester.  Your level of mastery updates through the semester based on current and past performance, and may go up or down just like a grade.  As a general rule, a level of mastery of 5 indicates &quot;A&quot; level mastery, 4 &quot;B&quot; level, and so on.  Some assignments may provide feedback in real time, for example, by telling your if your calculation is correct or not as you enter it in your notebook; although there is no grade assigned to this, it is considered when judging your mastery and you should be easily getting the correct answer on all items by the end of the semester.</p>
<p>Each SLO is given a score of 5 points in Canvas, and your final grade will be determined by summing your score for each and dividing by 30 &#40;the total number of points possible&#41; and multiplying by 100.  This gives your average level of mastery and yields a number ranging from 0-100.  This will be compared to the scale below to determine your final grade. &#40;Relative weights for each SLO may change if needed.&#41;</p>
<p>If you are unsure how to calculate your grade please ask your instructor.</p>
<h3 id="grading_scale"><a href="#grading_scale" class="header-anchor">Grading Scale</a></h3>
<table><tr><th align="center">Number Range</th><th align="center">Letter Grade</th></tr><tr><td align="center">97-100</td><td align="center">A&#43;</td></tr><tr><td align="center">93-96.9</td><td align="center">A</td></tr><tr><td align="center">90-92.9</td><td align="center">A-</td></tr><tr><td align="center">87-89.9</td><td align="center">B&#43;</td></tr><tr><td align="center">83-86.9</td><td align="center">B</td></tr><tr><td align="center">80-82.9</td><td align="center">B-</td></tr><tr><td align="center">77-79.9</td><td align="center">C&#43;</td></tr><tr><td align="center">73-76.9</td><td align="center">C</td></tr><tr><td align="center">70-72.9</td><td align="center">C-</td></tr><tr><td align="center">67-69.9</td><td align="center">D&#43;</td></tr><tr><td align="center">63-66.9</td><td align="center">D</td></tr><tr><td align="center">60-62.9</td><td align="center">D-</td></tr><tr><td align="center">&lt;60</td><td align="center">F</td></tr></table>
<p>These grades indicate levels in mastery from excellent to poor.  Students are responsible for knowing class attendance, withdrawal, and drop-add policies and procedures.</p>
