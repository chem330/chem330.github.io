<p>The objective of this experiment is to conduct a statistical analysis of the error associated with different methods of measuring the volume of liquids.  Aliquots of distilled water in will be measured several different ways, using beakers, graduated cylinders, volumetric glass pipets, and mechanical pipets.  The mass of each sample will be measured using an analytical balance and the density of each sample will be calculated.  You will then conduct a statistical analysis of the error associated with the different methods used in the experiment, comparing your data with class data.  Refer to the Error Analysis handout posted in Blackboard for calculations.</p>
<h1 id="part_1_measuring_volume_with_a_beaker"><a href="#part_1_measuring_volume_with_a_beaker" class="header-anchor">Part 1: Measuring Volume with a Beaker</a></h1>
<p>Use a 25 mL beaker to measure 15 mL of distilled water.  Use a balance to measure the mass of this 15 mL sample of water.  Calculate the density of the water.  Pour the water out, and repeat 4 more times.  Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the density of the water.  Put your mean on Canvas in the table entitled &quot;Part 1, class data.&quot;</p>
<h1 id="part_2_measuring_volume_with_a_graduated_cylinder"><a href="#part_2_measuring_volume_with_a_graduated_cylinder" class="header-anchor">Part 2: Measuring Volume with a Graduated Cylinder</a></h1>
<p>Use a graduated cylinder to measure 15 mL of distilled water.  Use a balance to measure the mass of this 15 mL sample.  Calculate the density of the water.  Pour the water out and repeat 4 more times.  Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the density of the water.  Put your mean on Canvas in the table entitled &quot;Part 2, class data.&quot;</p>
<h1 id="part_3_measuring_volume_with_a_pipette"><a href="#part_3_measuring_volume_with_a_pipette" class="header-anchor">Part 3: Measuring Volume with a Pipette</a></h1>
<h2 id="volumetric_pipette"><a href="#volumetric_pipette" class="header-anchor">Volumetric Pipette</a></h2>
<p>Use a volumetric pipet to measure 15 mL of distilled water into a clean, dry beaker.  Use a balance to measure the mass of this 15 mL sample.  Calculate the density of the water.  Pour the water out and repeat 4 more times.  Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the density of the water.  Put your mean on Canvas in the table entitled &quot;Part 3A, class data.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="mechanical_pipette"><a href="#mechanical_pipette" class="header-anchor">Mechanical Pipette</a></h2>
<p>Use a 5 mL mechanical pipet to measure 15 mL of distilled water.  Get the mass of a small beaker, then collect the 15 mL of water in the dry beaker.  Use a balance to measure the mass of this 15 mL sample.  Calculate the density of the water.  Pour the water out and repeat 4 more times.  Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the density of the water.  Put your mean on Canvas in the table entitled &quot;Part 3B, class data.&quot;</p>
<h1 id="part_4_density_determination_for_an_unknown_liquid"><a href="#part_4_density_determination_for_an_unknown_liquid" class="header-anchor">Part 4: Density Determination for an Unknown Liquid</a></h1>
<p>Use one of the above methods to measure the density of an unknown liquid 5 times.  Use 5 mL of the unknown liquid for each measurement of the mass.  Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the density of your unknown.  In your lab report, indicate which of the above methods you used to determine the density.</p>
<h1 id="part_5_other_factors_affecting_precision"><a href="#part_5_other_factors_affecting_precision" class="header-anchor">Part 5: Other Factors Affecting Precision</a></h1>
<p>Factors other than the precision of equipment can affect the precision of an experiment.  For example, sample size may affect precision.  Personal bias, especially in reading volume from a graduated cylinder or a beaker, may also affect precision.  Design a couple of short experiments to investigate some other factors &#40;other than precision of equipment&#41; that may affect precision.  In your notebook, be sure it is clear what factors you are looking at and what your experiment is.</p>
<h1 id="lab_write_up"><a href="#lab_write_up" class="header-anchor">Lab Write Up</a></h1>
<p>In addition to the standard lab report format, your report for this experiment should include the following:  </p>
<ol>
<li><p>For each set of class data, calculate the mean, standard deviation, and the 50&#37; and 95&#37; confidence limits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For your individual data tables &#40;properly labeled&#41;, include the means and standard deviations that you calculated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Which had the smallest standard deviation, your data or the class data?  Is this what you expected?  Why or why not?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Discuss the magnitude of the random &#40;indeterminate&#41; error in measurements using the different methods for measuring volume.  Which method has the smallest random error?  Why?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do you suspect any systematic error in this experiment?  Why?  What could &#40;or should&#41; be done to correct it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
