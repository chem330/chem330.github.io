<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Environmental aquatic chemistry is the branch of environmental chemistry that deals with chemical phenomena in water. Aquatic chemistry is concerned with the chemical processes affecting the distribution and circulation of chemical compounds in natural waters. One goal is to describe and predict the chemical behavior of oceans, estuaries, rivers, lakes, groundwater, and soil water systems, and to describe the processes involved in water treatment. The study of aquatic chemistry draws on the fundamentals of chemistry but is also influenced by other sciences, especially geology and biology.</p>
<p>This course is an introduction to environmental aquatic chemistry. It is a hybrid between a traditional quantitative analysis course and aquatic chemistry course, focusing on both the analytical and theoretical aspects of aquatic chemistry. Topics such as colorimetric, gravimetric, titrimetric, and instrumental analysis will be covered along with the distribution, fate, transport, and reaction kinetics of chemical species in the aquatic environment. It is expected that students will have taken CHEM 139 and CHEM 140 (the General Chemistry sequence) prior to enrolling in this course; CHEM 232 (Quantitative Analysis) is recommended but not required. Simultaneous enrollment in CHEM 330 Lab is expected.</p>
<h2 id="student-learning-outcomes">Student Learning Outcomes</h2>

<h2 id="field-work">Field Work</h2>
<p>Portions of this course will be conducted outdoors in the field while collecting water samples for analysis. This work may occur both on and off campus. This year, we will travel to Black Mountain, NC to collect water samples from the Swannanoa River; the analysis results will be shared with the Town of Black Mountain stormwater program. Students should make every effort to attend this field trip, and you will receive a grade for participation in the trip. Any students not attending will be required to complete a makeup assignment with equal time and effort committments as the field trip. Field work will occur rain or shine – please see the <a href="https://chem330.github.io/lab-syllabus/#field_work">lab syllabus</a> for a list of recommended materials to bring with you to the field.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Your final grade for the semester will be weighted thusly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cumulative Grade: 90%<br />
</li>
<li>Discretionary: 10%</li>
</ul>
<p>Your <strong>cumulative grade</strong> will be calculated as the total points you earned divided by the total points available (x 100%). For exams, quizzes, and classwork, each question or assignment will specify the number of points available.</p>
<p><strong>Discretionary</strong> points are determined at the end of the semester based on participation, effort, attendance, and overall respect for your peers/classmates, your instructor, and their time, both inside and outside the classroom.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>
<p><strong>Technology use in the classroom:</strong> Several studies have shown that hand-written notes are most beneficial in helping students retain information, and my observation has been that laptops and other electronic tend to be more of a distraction than a benefit during lecture. Thus, students are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to take notes with paper and pencil and asked to refrain from using laptops and other mobile devices during lecture. Likewise, cell phones should not be used during class – set a schedule to automatically put them on do not disturb during lecture and leave them in your backpack or purse! Tablets, cell phones, and computers are never allowed out during an exam.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19:</strong> At the time of this writing, it is expected that all lab activities will occur in person. Please avoid coming to class if you experience and cold, flu, or <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">COVID19 symptoms</a>, have been diagnosed with COVID19, or have been in contact with someone who’s recently tested positive for COVID19.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance:</strong> Attendance to all class periods is expected. Please email your instructor <em>ahead of time</em> if you encounter circumstances that absolutely prevent you from making it to class. Students are responsible for covering any material they miss while absent on their own, and are further responsible for any work they miss while absent. Due dates are not extended because a student was absent, unless otherwise agreed upon between the student and instructor in advance.</p>
<p><em>If you experience any symptoms of COVID-19, cold, flu, or other contagious sickness please do NOT come to class! Likewise, do not attend if you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or is suspected to have COVID-19. Please maintain diligent communication with your instructor during these situations and appropriate accommodations will be made.</em></p>
<p><strong>Inclement Weather:</strong> Please check the University website for campus closings during times of bad weather. Your safety is a priority when traveling.
