<ul>
<li><p>For this analysis, follow EPA Method 310.1 - Alkalinity &#40;Titrimetric, pH 4.5&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Complete your titration as soon as possible after sample collection, and store it at 4 C prior to titration if you must store it at all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use your <strong>unaltered</strong> sample for the titration.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Nitrate-nitrogen may be present in small amounts in fresh domestic wastewater.  However, it is seldom found in influents to treatment plants because the nitrate serves as an oxygen source in the biologically unstable wastewater.  On the other hand, nitrate is often found in the effluents of biological treatment plants, because it represents the final form of nitrogen from the oxidation of organic nitrogen compounds.  Trickling-filter and activated sludge treatment plant effluents may contain from 0 to 50 mg/L nitrate, depending on the total nitrogen content of the influent, the degree of loading, and the temperature of the sewage.</p>
<p>Nitrate may also be found in river water, lake water, and most importantly in ground water.  The nitrate may originate from sewage, or in rural areas, it may be produced by fertilizer or barnyard runoff.  The U.S. Public Health Service designated safe limit for nitrate in water is 45 ppm nitrate or 10 ppm nitrate-nitrogen.  Nitrate in drinking water is particularly dangerous to small children, infants, and unborn fetuses.</p>
<p>In this experiment, nitrate will be determined spectrophotometrically using the Vernier SpectroVis.  Spectrophometry is a commonly used method to determine aqueous anions.  The fundamentals of absorption spectrophotometry are shown below.  A light source shines light through a sample cell &#40;a cuvette&#41; and onto a detection system, which serves to convert the light into an electric signal &#40;Figure 1&#41;.  The basic idea is that as the concentration of the colored complex increases in the cuvette, we would expect less light to be transmitted to the detection system.  Hence, we are interested in the absorption of light by the sample:</p>
<p>FIGURE 1</p>
<p>A series of solutions is prepared with a known amount of analyte &#40;standards&#41; and the absorbance is measured on the Vernier SpectroVis.  A graph is then prepared of absorbance &#40;y-axis&#41; versus concentration &#40;x-axis&#41;.  This graph is called a standard curve or calibration curve.  The calibration curve will be used to develop a quantitative relationship between concentration and absorbance.  Then absorbance will be measured for the water samples, and the graph will be used to calculate the concentration of analyte in the samples.  An example is shown below in Figure 2.</p>

<p><em>A a 500-mg L\(^{-1}\) NO\(_3^-\) stock solution has been prepared for you.</em></p>

<li><p>Prepare a 10-ppm nitrate intermediate stock solution using the stock solution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using your intermediate stock solution, prepare 5 standards with concentrations ranging from &#40;approximately&#41; 0â€“10 mg L\(^{-1}\).  Make 25 mL of each solution, and remember that \(C_1V_1 = C_2V_2\).</p>

<p>The following procedure should be performed on each of your 6 calibration standards and each of your water samples.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Place 25 mL of each standard and sample into separate 50-mL flasks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a blank with 25 mL of deionized water.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add the contents of one NitraVer5 Nitrate reagent packet to each sample.  <strong>Be careful&#33;</strong>  There is Cd metal in the reagent packet, so the contents of the reagent packet are toxic.  Wear gloves, goggles, and avoid inhaling the reagent powder.  Be careful about what you touch with your gloves.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Swirl each flask vigorously for 1 minute.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Wait at least 5 minutes, but no longer than 15 minutes before reading the absorbance of each sample.</p>
<h3 id="spectrovis"><a href="#spectrovis" class="header-anchor">SpectroVis</a></h3>
<p><strong>Connect the SpectroVis Plus to the computer through the USB port.  Place a blank distilled water sample in a cuvette.  Use a Kimwipe to dry the outside of the cuvette and to remove fingerprints.  Place the cuvette in the SpectroVis so that the transparent side faces the white light.  Select: Experiment at the top, and then Calibrate.  Allow the lamp to warm up for 90 s.  Select Finish calibration and then OK.  Next, generate a spectrum for your standard with the highest concentration of nitrate by clicking on the Configure Spectrophotometer Data Collection button at the top that looks like a rainbow of color.  This will be an Absorbance vs. Wavelength experiment.  Click O.K., then click on the large green button at the top.  Save the spectrum data by choosing the Store Latest Run from the Experiment menu.  Then click on the red stop button at the top.  Determine which wavelength gave the highest absorbance value.  Next, you will click the Configure Spectrophotometer Data Collection button and choose Absorbance vs. Concentration, enter ppm for the concentration units, and then check the box next to wavelength that gave the highest absorbance reading.   Click O.K. then analyze the sample, then  click the round keep button to save the data in the data table.  The data can be exported to Excel.  You may have to dilute your samples to get the absorbance values less than 1. For each of your standards and samples, place the solution in a cuvette after the color has developed, wipe the cuvette with a Kimwipe, insert the cuvette in the SpectroVis, and select the large green arrow at the top right to read the absorbance of the solution.  Then click on the keep button to have the data from your standards saved in the data table.  Also, record the identity of your standards and samples, along with the absorbance values, in the table in your lab notebook.  BE SURE TO RINSE THE CUVETTE 3 TIMES WITH DISTILLED WATER BETWEEN EACH SOLUTION TO BE MEASURED.  Collect all of your solutions and rinses in a beaker.  When you have completed your experiment, pour your waste solutions that you have collected into the waste bottle at the front of the lab. Export your data to an Excel spreadsheet.  Prepare a calibration curve using the six nitrate standards &#40;0 to 10 ppm nitrate&#41;.  Prepare a calibration graph with the Absorbance on the y-axis and the concentration in ppm on the x-axis.   Label the axes and include units for the concentration.  Add a trendline to your graph, and add the equation and R2 value for the trendline.  DO NOT FORCE THE TRENDLINE THROUGH ZERO.  Use the equation for the trendline to calculate the nitrate concentration in your water samples.  Then use the nitrate concentration to calculate the nitrate-nitrogen concentration for each water sample.</strong></p>
