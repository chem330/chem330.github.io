Error Analysis
=========================

\toc

# Background

In this lab, you will examine the uncertainty associated with different ways of delivering a specified volume of liquid.  You will do this by measuring deionized water using four methods: (1) a beaker, (2) a graduated cylinder, (3) a volumetric glass pipette, and (4) a mechanical pipette. Each of these will be compared against an analytical balance.  As a final exercise, you will choose one of these methods to use to determe the identity (based on density) of an unknown liquid with the **smallest possible uncertainty**.  To obtain a bigger dataset for analysis, we will compile the data and determine statistics at the class level.

# Part 1: Measuring Volume with a Beaker

Use a 25 mL beaker to measure 15 mL of distilled water.  Use a balance to measure the mass of this 15 mL sample of water.  Calculate the density of the water.  Pour the water out, and repeat 4 more times.  Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the density of the water.  Put your mean on assignment page in Canvas in the table entitled "Part 1: Beakers".

# Part 2: Measuring Volume with a Graduated Cylinder

Use a graduated cylinder to measure 15 mL of distilled water.  Use a balance to measure the mass of this 15 mL sample.  Calculate the density of the water.  Pour the water out and repeat 4 more times.  Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the density of the water.  Put your mean on Canvas in the table entitled "Part 2: Graduated Cylinders".

# Part 3: Volumetric Pipette

Use a volumetric pipet to measure 15 mL of distilled water into a clean, dry beaker.  Use a balance to measure the mass of this 15 mL sample.  Calculate the density of the water.  Pour the water out and repeat 4 more times.  Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the density of the water.  Put your mean on Canvas in the table entitled "Part 3A: Transfer Pipettes".

# Part 4: Mechanical Pipette

Use a 5 mL mechanical pipet to measure 15 mL of distilled water.  Get the mass of a small beaker, then collect the 15 mL of water in the dry beaker.  Use a balance to measure the mass of this 15 mL sample.  Calculate the density of the water.  Pour the water out and repeat 4 more times.  Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the density of the water.  Put your mean on Canvas in the table entitled "Part 3B: Mechanical Pipettes".

# Part 5: Density Determination for an Unknown Liquid

Use one of the above methods to measure the density of an unknown liquid 5 times.  Use 5 mL of the unknown liquid for each measurement of the mass.  Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the density of your unknown.  In your lab report, indicate which of the above methods you used to determine the density.
