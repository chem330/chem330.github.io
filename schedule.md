# Tentative Lab Schedule

The lab consists of two parts: (1) *learning* techniques by completing basic labs during the first part of the semester and (2) *applying* those techniques to study a real-world problem during the second part of the semester.

Lab assignments are due at 23:59:59 on Tuesday unless otherwise specified. The best place to keep track of due dates is Canvas.

*This schedule is subject to change as needed.*
